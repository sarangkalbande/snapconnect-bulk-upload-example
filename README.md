# SNAPconnect Example - Bulk Uploader

The bulkUpload script can be used to perform operations on large lists 
of SNAP nodes.  The tool has the ability to scan multiple channels and 
network IDs to locate nodes, and after finding nodes can disable
multicast forwarding, change the channel and network ID, and upload SPY 
files to the nodes.

## Running This Example

### MAC file format

The input file for the bulkUpload script should be a list of MAC addresses.
You can separate the MAC addresses with new lines or spaces.

```
Example:
AABBCC DDEEFF
001122 334455
```

Additionally, a single column of a CSV file may be used to provide the 
list of MAC addresses as well.  If you are using a CSV file, make sure 
to use the -c option to specify which column contains the MAC addresses.

### Running the bulkUpload module as a standalone demo

```bash
python bulkUpload.py --help
```

This command will display the command-line options:

```
    Usage: bulkUpload.py [options]

    Options:
    -h, --help     Show this help message and exit
    -e ENCRYPT, --encryption=ENCRYPT
        	       Enable encryption
    -k ENCRYPTION_KEY, --encryptionKey=ENCRYPTION_KEY
                   Key for encryption
    -m MACFILE, --macfile=MACFILE
                   Mac list
    -s SPYFILE, --spyfile=SPYFILE
                   SPY file
    -b COMPORT, --bridge=COMPORT
                   COM port 'COM4', 'USB100', or 'USB200'
    -c COLUMN, --column=COLUMN
                   CSV column
    -f, --find     Find nodes on any channel/NID
    -n NETWORK, --network=NETWORK
                   Change network (ch,0xNeId)
    -x, --nofwd    Kill repeaters (no forwarding)
    -r RETRY, --retry=RETRY
                   Retry RPCs (def 3x)
    -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
                   Timeout RPCs, in seconds(def 3s)
    -z REMOTECONN, --remoteConn=REMOTECONN
                   Connect to a remote SNAP network via IP address  (Ex
                        74.198.44.130)
    -j REMOTEBRADDR, --remoteBridgeAddress=REMOTEBRADDR
                   Remote conn requires the SNAP bridge address in form "123456" or "12.34.56"
```

### Example of Local use

```bash
python bulkUpload.py -m my_mac_file.txt
```

- Pings the list of mac addresses in file "my_mac_file.txt"
- Uses the default bridge device "USB100"  (paddle board)
- Will only try and ping the device on the current channel of the bridge device (USB)

### Example of Remote use

```bash
python bulkUpload.py -z 10.84.5.80 -j 03FF01 -m my_mac_file.txt -f
```

- Pings the list of mac addresses in file "my_mac_file.txt"
- Will attempt to connect to an E10 with an IP address of 10.84.5.80
- Will scan through all channels in an attempt to ping each specified address

The uploader displays its progress on the console, and also creates a file
called "bulkUpload.log".  If the log file exists, it will be appended to with
each run of the program. Otherwise a new log file will be created.

The output files generated provide the user a list of the nodes that did
and did not respond, as well as any nodes that successfully uploaded
a .spy file or failed during the process. These files will remain blank 
if no nodes fit the category (ex. if no upload was performed). These files 
are overwritten with the results of each bulk upload process.

## Common Uses

To find a series of nodes in a .csv (listed in first column) using a 
device with an IP of 10.84.5.80 and a SNAP bridge with an address of 03.FF.01

```bash
python bulkUpload.py -f -m nodeList.csv -c 1 -z 10.84.5.80 -j 03FF01
```

To move a series of nodes in a .csv to a different channel

```bash
python bulkUpload.py -f -m nodeList.csv -c 1 -z 10.84.5.80 -j 03FF01 -n 3,0xbeef
```

To move nodes to another channel and also upload a new script

```bash
python bulkUpload.py -f -m myNodes.txt -c 1 -z 10.84.5.80 -j 03FF01 -n 3,0xbeef -s myScript.spy
```

To simply ping a list of nodes on one channel

```bash
python bulkUpload.py -c 0 -z 10.84.5.80 -j 03FF01
```

## Notes

### Stopping the program during execution

If you kill the program during operation, the SNAP bridge of the remote
connection will remain on the last Channel/NID combination associated 
with the halted bulk upload process. Simply reboot the module or run
another bulk upload that runs to completion.

### Channel Order

The system is designed to begin with the most commonly used channels 
rather than blindly beginning on channel 0 each time. Once a node is 
discovered, the corresponding channel will be placed at the beginning of 
the list. This cuts down on the time finding devices clustered
together on the same groups of channels.

### Remote Connection

It is important you specify the SNAP address of the RF bridge to be used
for the remote connection (future version might avoid this). You will 
not receive an error if you attempt a connection to an IP address not 
associated with a valid SNAPconnect instance.

### Output files

The result files (ex. Result_resp.txt) will be overwritten with the 
results of each bulk upload process that runs to completion (ie. save the
file with a different filename if you wish to save the list.)

### Large Networks

Increase the timeout (-t) if you have a large network and want to allow
more time for the node to respond.
